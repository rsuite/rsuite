# Icons

React Suite currently provides 200+ official icons and will continue to be updated. React Suite also supports the use of third-party component libraries, such as [Font awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/master/js-packages/%40fortawesome), [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons), [Iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/), etc.
