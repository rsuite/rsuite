# Whisper

The `Whisper` component is a trigger for displaying overlay elements. It's primarily used to wrap components like `Tooltip` and `Popover` that need to be shown on hover, providing unified triggering behavior and positioning functionality. With `Whisper`, you can flexibly control the display and hiding of overlay layers, as well as customize triggering events.
