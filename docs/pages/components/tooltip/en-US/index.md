### Triggering events

`Whisper` provides a `trigger` props, which is used to control the display of `Tooltip` in different business scenarios. Props values ​​include:

- `click`: It will be triggered when the element is clicked, and closed when clicked again.
- `contextMenu`: It will be triggered when you trigger contextMenu on the element.
- `focus`: It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's `tab` key.
- `hover`: Will be triggered when the cursor (mouse pointer) is hovering over the element.
- `active`: It is triggered when the element is activated.
- `none`: No trigger event, generally used when it needs to be triggered by a method.

### Container and prevent overflow

<!--{include:`container.md`}-->

### Disabled elements

Elements with the disabled attribute aren’t interactive, meaning users cannot hover or click them to trigger a popover (or tooltip). As a workaround, you’ll want to trigger the overlay from a wrapper `<div>` or `<span>` and override the pointer-events on the disabled element.
