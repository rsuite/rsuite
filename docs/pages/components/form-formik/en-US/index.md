### Validation

### Validation with Yup

Yup is a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation. Formik integrates well with Yup, making it easy to use Yup schemas with Formik forms.

> If you prefer to use Zod, consider using the community-provided adapter [zod-formik-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-formik-adapter).

### Other data entry components

All data entry components in React Suite can be used with Formik. The following will demonstrate how to use Formik with the `DatePicker` and `Rate` components.
