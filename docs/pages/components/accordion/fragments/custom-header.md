      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
      <p>
        <strong> Declarative:</strong> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
        simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and
        render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code
        more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,
        then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript
        instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out
        of the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make assumptions about the rest of
        your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing
        code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React
        Native.

      Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It
      builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and
      component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they
      simple or complex.
