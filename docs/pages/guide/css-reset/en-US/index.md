# CSS Reset

With regard to typography, after using the React Suite style, you can use the HTML elements to typeset directly for displaying titles, paragraphs, lists, links, and more.

> If you don't need these styles , you can [disable import it][config-reset-import].

<div id="ad-view"></div>

### `<a>`: The Anchor element

The HTML `<a>` element (or anchor element), along with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.

You can also implement a Link through the Button component.

<!--{include:`anchor.md`}-->

### `<h1>`–`<h6>`: The HTML Section Heading elements

The following code shows all the heading levels, in use.

<!--{include:`heading.md`}-->

### `<p>`: The Paragraph element

The HTML `<p>` element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

<!--{include:`paragraph.md`}-->

### `<ul>`: The Unordered List element

The HTML `<ul>` element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

<!--{include:`list-ul.md`}-->

### `<ol>`: The Ordered List element

The HTML `<ol>` element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list.

<!--{include:`list-ol.md`}-->

### `<dl>`：The Description List element

The HTML `<dl>` element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the `<dt>` element) and descriptions (provided by `<dd>` elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

<!--{include:`list-dl.md`}-->
