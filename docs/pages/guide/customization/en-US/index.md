# Customization ðŸŽ¨

React Suite uses [Less][less] to develop styles and defines a series of variables that can be customized using [Modify Variables][modify variables]. This includes but is not limited to customizing theme colors, resizing component fillet radii, modifying font styles, replacing auxiliary colors, and so on. The code in the following example is a new action in `custom-theme.less`.

### Import less

Create a separate `.less` file as follows, and then introduce this file.

```less
@import '~rsuite/styles/index.less';
@import 'custom-theme.less'; // Style customization.
```

### Custom Theme Colors

Sets the primary color.

```less
@primary-color: #00bcd4;
```

After you configure the theme base color, a set of swatches (`@H050` - `@H900`, H is Hue) reference is generated: [light.less][light.less].

#### Dark mode

If you want to also customize the built-in dark mode, you can use `@primary-color-dark` variable.

### Adjusts the fillet radius of the assembly.

```less
@border-radius: 2px;
```

### Modify the font style.

```less
@font-family-base: 'Lucida Grande', 'Avenir Next', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
  'PingFang SC', 'Hiragino Sans GB', 'Microsoft YaHei', STXihei, sans-serif;
@font-size-base: 14px;
```

### Secondary palette

Secondary palettes acts as auxiliary colors which often stands for different states - informational, successful, warnings and errors, respectively. You can customize the secondary palette to change the look of [Message](/components/message), [Notification](/components/notification) and other needs to display the states of the components.

| Color     | State     |
| --------- | --------- |
| `@green`  | `success` |
| `@blue`   | `info`    |
| `@yellow` | `warning` |
| `@red`    | `error`   |

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```less
@green:  #4caf50;
@blue:   #2196f3;
@yellow: #ffb300;
@red:    #f44336;
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Dark mode

If you want to also customize the built-in dark mode, you can use corresponding `@green-dark`, `@blue-dark`, `@yellow-dark`, `@red-dark` variable.

### Disable ripple animation

React Suite includes a Material-like ripple effect in some clickable components like Buttons. If you don't want this effect, you can turn off this flag.

```less
@enable-ripple-effect: false;
```

### Disable IE polyfill

By default, React Suite includes some compatible styles for IE 11. If you don't need these styles, you can remove theme by turning off this flag.

```less
@enable-ie-polyfill: false;
```

### Disable HTML styles reset

```less
@enable-css-reset: false;
```

### More Custom Configurations

We provide a rich [variable][variables.less], if still unable to meet your customized needs, welcome to our [issue][issue].

## Webpack compiles multiple themes

React Suite provides a Webpack assist tool [webpack-multiple-themes-compile][webpack-multiple-themes-compile], which can generate multiple sets of CSS files according to the configuration when the project is compiled, and then introduce different CSS files in different theme environments to achieve multi-theme switching effect. The principle of implementation is based on the substitution of Less's variables, so it must rely on Less compilation, we will illustrate it by the following example.

- **First**, let's look at the configuration of compiling Less into CSS by Webpack by default:

```js
const ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');
const extractLess = new ExtractTextPlugin(`style.[hash].css`);

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        loader: extractLess.extract({
          use: [{ loader: 'css-loader' }, { loader: 'less-loader?javascriptEnabled=true' }]
        })
      }
    ]
  }
  // ...Other configurations.
};
```

- **Then**, hand the Less file to `webpack-multiple-themes-compile` and configure the `themesConfig` parameter to define the variables needed under the theme.

```js
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const multipleThemesCompile = require('webpack-multiple-themes-compile');

const webpackConfigs = {
  // There is another options.
};

module.exports = merge(
  webpackConfigs,
  multipleThemesCompile({
    themesConfig: {
      default: {},
      green: {
        'primary-color': '#008000'
      },
      yellow: {
        'primary-color': '#ffff00'
      }
    }
  })
);
```

If you use `html-webpack-plugin`, in order to avoid introducing all styles into html, you need to add the `excludeChunks` parameter to exclude topic-related CSS.

```diff
 new HtmlwebpackPlugin({
   ...
+  excludeChunks: ['themes']
 })
```

- **Finally**, after running the Webpack command, multiple sets of CSS will be generated, and corresponding CSS will be introduced in different theme environments according to their own business requirements, thus implementing multi-topic switching. For detailed implementation, please refer to the example project [multiple-themes][multiple-themes]

```
â”œâ”€â”€ theme-default.css
â”œâ”€â”€ theme-green.css
â””â”€â”€ theme-yellow.css
```

If you use [`create-react-app`][cra] to create a project, you can modify it with [`react-app-rewire-less`][rarl] and [`react-app-rewire-define-plugin`][rardp]. For more details, see [Use in create-react-app][use-with-create-app].
