# High-contrast mode

React Suite has a built-in high-contrast mode.
It uses a limited color palette with contrasting colors to make an interface easier to use.
It's useful when users have photosensitivity or contrast issues, as well as in low-light environments.

## Usage

Add `.rs-theme-high-contrast` class on `<body>` or root `<html>` element.
