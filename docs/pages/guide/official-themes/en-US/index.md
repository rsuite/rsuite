# Official Themes

React Suite officially provides the following 3 themes by default, you only need a simple configuration to use.

- `light`: Light theme (default).
- `dark`: Dark theme. It is usually called the night mode ðŸŒ˜, to darken the tone in a low-light environment to relieve visual fatigue.
- `high-contrast`: High contrast theme. It uses a limited color palette with contrasting colors to make an interface easier to use.
  It's useful when users have photosensitivity or contrast issues, as well as in low-light environments.

## Usage

### 1. Import style files

```
@import '~rsuite/dist/rsuite.min.css';
```

If you use `Less`, you need to enable the corresponding theme through a variable.

```
@import '~rsuite/styles/index.less';

// Enable dark mode
@enable-dark-mode: true;

// Enable high contrast mode
@enable-high-contrast: true;
```

â˜† We recommend you to use Less, because it will only load the styles of the corresponding theme when you compile the generated CSS, thereby reducing the size of the CSS file.

### 2.CustomProvider

If your application has been included in the [`<CustomProvider>`](/components/custom-provider) container, then you only need to add another `theme` attribute and configure your corresponding theme name.

```jsx
function App(props) {
  return <CustomProvider theme="dark">{props.children}</CustomProvider>;
}
```

[`<CustomProvider>`](/components/custom-provider) will add a global `className` to the `<body>` element during the component rendering process, so that the child elements will act on the corresponding theme style.

If you want to change the theme of only a part of the component, just add the `.rs-theme-dark` class or the `.rs-theme-high-contrast` class to any container element to use the corresponding theme style .

If the themes provided above cannot meet the visual requirements of your application, you can meet the [customization](/guide/customization) requirements of your business through some of our predefined parameter configurations.
